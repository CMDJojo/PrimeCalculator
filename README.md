## PrimeCalculator BETA
This is a BETA verision of primeCalculator, featuring the SEARCH function with the new PRIME_BLAZE algorithm that is extreamly fast compared to the older algorithms.

There will be little to no documentation to BETA releases.

#### Changenotes:
- Added SEARCH with the new PRIME_BLAZE algorithm.
- Added a safe-memory-mode that saves the files using attendFile when the SEARCH range is above 50 million
- !!IMPORTANT!! If you want to search for very  high ranges, like up to 1,000 million, you HAVE to increase the working memory using --max_old_space_size and set it to as many megabytes you want to reserve for node.
- Temporarley disabled FIND because of reconstruction
